Do you want to head to the Dark Forest (1) or the Winding Canyons (2)?




FOREST

You venture into the mysterious Silent Forest, where strange phenomena obscure the light of day.
Meeting the Hunters:
However, before you have the chance to step further into the forest, a whistling arrow slices through the air, narrowly missing hitting you.
Suddenly skilled and silent hunters reveal themselves, emerging from the shadows of the forest. Their leader, an individual with a cold look, declares their intention to kill you if you do not give them information on the location of the jewel which allows you to escape from Junglophia. You are then presented with 2 choices:
(1) Discreet Flight: this option allows you to bypass the hunters and continue your quest without altercation, but it requires a silent and careful retreat, because these poachers are extremely skilled.
(2) Negotiation: you could propose a hunter market, exchanging information or resources in exchange for your security. This option could avoid open conflict.
What do you want to do ? Flee(1) or Negotiate(2)

You make the first decision.
You disappear into the shadows of the forest, leaving the hunters confused and frustrated. The adventurers continue their quest with the relic, but leave behind a latent tension with the hunters.

You choose the second decision.
You decide to make a Diplomatic agreement. However, the group of hunters does not seem to be of the same opinion as you. The hunters do not want to hear anything and then start running after you. You do not have time to lose them and you get killed by an arrow right in the heart. -1 life

(Column 1 – Column 3) x 11 = Column 2
Line 1
42 – 38 = 4 x 11 = 44
Line 2
28 – 23 = 5 x 11 = 55
Line 3
39 – 37 = 2 x 11 = 22




victory = yes
Congratulations, you have found the solution to this riddle! You gain 1 life and 50 points

victory = no
Too bad you don't have the right solution you lose 25 points



CANYON

Beyond the desert expanses, you now plunge into the canyons, where every rock face sparkles with ethereal crystals. The canyons reveal a sparkling spectacle, but also hide luminous mysteries that defy comprehension.
As you delve deeper into the mystical mist of the Canyons, you come face to face with venomous snakes with glistening scales. These creatures, hidden in the thick veil of darkness, prove to be formidable.
The venom from their bites is imbued with ancient magic, a magic that denies reality itself. To avoid being poisoned you can choose to bypass the path by jumping from one bank of the canyons to the other or else try to defend yourself using a crystal that is buried in the canyon rock.
Defend yourself(1) or jump out of the canyon(2)?


(1)
You choose to defend yourself. You look around you and see a crystal buried in the rock. With the help of your friends you manage to extract it and you use it to dazzle the venomous snakes thanks to the light enclosed by the walls of the canyon. This distraction allows you to pass between the creatures and lets your journey continue unharmed.


(2)
You decide to take another path to avoid attracting the poisonous snakes in your direction, however the creatures surround you and you have no choice but to jump from one end to the other. The distance is so big but it is your last chance to survive their bites. With a determined step you take the plunge but you were right the distance did not allow you to reach the other side so easily and you sink at the sight of the canyon heights.You lose a life -1life


After facing these fearsome creatures you reach an area where a strange mist rises from the depths of the canyon. You must choose:
Cross the Mist (1): You can choose to venture into the mist, despite its mysterious appearance. This decision could carry unknown risks.
Bypass the Mist (2): You and the adventurers can choose to bypass the foggy area, opting for a safer but potentially longer path.


?? + ?? = 8
 +   +
?? - ?? = 6
 =    =
 13   8

3.5 + 4.5 = 8
  +    +
9.5 - 3.5 = 6
 =     =
13     8




After having had this last ordeal a mysterious door opens through the rock of the walls of the mysterious gorges. You go to it and inside you wait for a man who seems to have waited for your arrival.You go to see him and he tells you that he is in possession of the jewel.You do not return it held the famous stone that you seek to obtain since your arrival.
But to get such a reward the merchant asks for a certain amount of money; he confides in you saying, “For some gold the victory is yours but if you do not have enough coins I can do nothing for you”.
You need :
When you take out your purse, you count your coins.
